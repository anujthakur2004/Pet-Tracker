# Pet Activity Tracker

This is a small web app made with **Django (Python)** and simple **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It helps pet owners keep track of their pet's activities like walks, meals, and medicines.

## Stack Used
- **Backend:** Django 5
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (mobile-friendly), JavaScript
- **Storage:** In-memory (data is stored temporarily while the server is running)

I used Django because it is easy to set up, good for beginners, and fast to build small projects.
